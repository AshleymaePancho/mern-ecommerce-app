# MERN E-Commerce Application

A full-stack e-commerce web application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).  
This project demonstrates core concepts of modern web application development including RESTful APIs, authentication, database modeling, and scalable backend architecture.
